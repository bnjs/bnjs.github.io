# Introduction

### 30% of YC startup advice is generally applicable

### YC startup advice is for startups aiming for <span>hyper growth<span>

### You need a <span>great idea</span>, a <span>great product</span>, a <span>great team</span>, and <span>great execution</span>.

### The outcome of a startup is something like <span>idea x product x execution x team x luck</span>, where luck is a random number between zero and ten thousand.

`idea * product * execution * team * rand(10000)`

### Never start a startup just for the sake of doing so, but if you feel <span>compelled by a particular problem</span> and that you think starting a company is the best way to solve it.

### <span>Passion first</span>, startup second

# Idea

## IDEAS MATTER

### Great execution towards <span>a terrible idea</span> will get you nowhere.

### Most great companies start with a great idea, <span>not a pivot</span>.

### Most successful pivots are a <span>pivot into something the founders themselves wanted</span>, not a random made up idea.

### When you're evaluating an idea, you need to think through the <span>size and the growth of the market, the growth strategy for the company, the defensibility strategy</span>, and so on, not just the product.

### Plans may become worthless, but <span>the exercise of planning is really valuable</span>

## LONG-TERM THINKING IS IMPORTANT

### You want <span>something that can develop</span> in interesting ways.

### Someday you need to build a business that is <span>difficult to replicate</span>

### <span>Idea first</span>, startup second.

## BE MISSION-ORIENTED

### The best companies are almost always <span>mission oriented</span>

### It’s difficult to get large groups of people to the <span>extreme levels of focus and productivity</span> that you need for a startup to be successful

### For that you need <span>an important mission</span> and <span>a great founding idea</span>.

### Good startups usually take <span>ten years</span>.

### If you don’t <span>love and believe in what you’re building</span>, you’re likely to give up at some point along the way.

### In many ways it’s <span>easier to start a hard startup</span> than an easy startup.

### <span>Companies that copy an existing idea</span> with very few new insights don’t excite people and they don’t compell the teams to work hard enough to be successful.

## GREAT IDEAS SOUND BAD

### The best ideas <span>often look terrible</span> at the beginning.

### You want an idea that turns into a <span>monopoly</span>, but you can’t get a monopoly in a big market right away, there’s too much competition for that.

### You have to <span>find a small market</span> in which you can get a monopoly and then <span>quickly expand</span>.

### This is why some great startup ideas look really bad at the beginning.

### It’s good if you can say something like, “Today only this small subset of users are going to use my product, but I’m going to get all of them and in the future almost everyone will use my product.”

### You need conviction in your own beliefs, and a willingness to ignore others' naysaying.

### If you do come up with a great idea, most people are going to think it’s bad, and that's a good sign.

### The truly good ideas don’t sound like they’re worth stealing.

### You want an idea about which you can say, “I know it sounds like a bad idea, but here’s specifically why it’s actually a great one.”

### You want to sound crazy, but you want to actually be right.

### You want an idea that not many other people are working on, and it’s OK if it doesn’t sound big at first.

### You need to take over a small specific market and expand from there.

### Unpopular but right, is what you’re going for.

## SMALL BUT RAPIDLY GROWING MARKETS

### You really want to take the time to think about how the market’s going to evolve.

### You need a market that’s going to be big in ten years.

### Think about the growth rate of the market rather than it’s current size, and think about if there’s any reason that it’s going to top out.

### A company that’s going after a small but rapidly growing market is a more attractive investment than a big but slow growing one.

### One of the big advantages of these small but rapidly growing markets, is that customers are usually pretty desperate for a solution, and they’ll put up with an imperfect but rapidly improving product.

### Student probably have better intuition about which markets are likely to start growing rapidly than older people do.

### You cannot create a market that doesn’t want to exist.

### You can basically change everything in a startup but the market.

### You want a market that’s going to grow really quickly.

### Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea and to start this particular company? Why couldn’t it have been done 2 years ago, and why will 2 years in the future be too late?

### The most successful YC startups all had a great idea and a great answer to "Why now?", and if you don’t you should be at least somewhat suspicious about it.

## BUILD SOMETHING YOU NEED, OR GET VERY CLOSE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS

### In general, it’s best if you’re building something that you yourself need.

### If you don’t need it yourself and you’re building something that someone else needs, realize that you’re at a big disadvantage and get very, very close to your customers.

## GOOD IDEAS ARE EASY TO EXPLAIN

### Good startup ideas are almost always very easy to explain and very easy to understand.

### If it takes more than a sentence to explain what you’re doing, it’s almost always a sign that it’s too complicated.

## CLONE IDEAS USUALLY FAIL

### The best ideas are usually either very different from existing companies in one important way, or totally new.

### A company that's a clone of something else that already exists, with some small or made up differentiator; usually fails.

## THINK MARKET FIRST, WHAT PEOPLE WANT

### If you can just learn to think about the market first, you will have a big leg up on most people starting startups.

### One of the most common mistakes is that people have not thought about the market first, and what people want first.

---

# Product

### Product is anything involved in your customer's interaction with what you built for them, including customer support and copywrite explaining the product.

## BUILD A GREAT PRODUCT

### To build a really great company you first have to turn a great idea into a great product.

### Until you’ve built a great product, almost nothing else matters.

### Most of your time should be spent either sitting in front of the computer working on the product or talking to customers.

### Other problems like raising money, getting more press, hiring, business development, etc. are significantly easier when you have a great product.

## MAKE SOMETHING USERS LOVE

### Step 1 is to build something that users love.

### Work on their product, talk to users, exercise, eat, and sleep, and very little else.

### Very few companies that go on to be super successful get there without first building something that users love.

### A lot of good-on-paper startups fail because they merely make something that people like.

### Making something that people want, but only a medium amount, is a great way to fail and not understand why you’re failing.

### It’s better to build something that a small number of users love, than a large number of users like.

### It’s much easier to expand from something that a small number of people love to something that a lot of people love, than from something that a lot of people like to a lot of people love.

### If you get this right, you can get a lot of other things wrong, but if you get this wrong, you can get everything else right and you’ll probably still fail.

## LOVE CREATES ORGANIC GROWTH

### One way that you know when this is working is that you’ll get growth by word of mouth.

### When people really love something, they tell their friends about it and you’ll see organic growth.

### If you think it’s OK that you’re not growing, it’s almost always a sign of real trouble.

### Sales and marketing are really important, but if you don’t have some early organic growth then your product probably isn’t good enough yet.

### A great product is the secret to longterm growth hacking.

### If you try to build a growth machine before you have a product that some people really love, you’re almost certainly going to waste your time.

### Don’t worry about your competitors raising a lot of money and what they may do in the future, they probably aren’t very good anyway.

### Very few startups die from competition. Most die because they themselves fail to make something users love.

## START SIMPLE

### Start with something simple, it's much easier to make a great product that way.

### Starting simple forces you to do one thing extremely well, and you have to do that to make something that people love.

## BE FANATICAL

### Successful founders are often fanatical about their products, the quality of small details, customer support, etc.

### These founders feel physical pain when the product sucks, and they want to wake up and fix it.

### They don’t ship crap, and if they do they fix it very, very quickly.

### And it definitely takes some level of fanaticism to build a great product.

## DO THINGS THAT DON'T SCALE

### You need some users to help with the feedback cycle, but the way to get those users is manually. You should go recruit them by hand.

### Do things that don't scale.

### Get users manually and remember that the goal is to get a small group of them to love you.

### Understand that group extremely well, get extremely close to them.

## TIGHT FEEDBACK LOOP

### You want to build an engine in the company that transforms feedback from users into product decisions, then get it back in front of the users and repeat.

### Ask users what they like and what they don’t like and watch them use the product.

### Ask users what they’d pay for, if they’d be really bummed if your company went away, what would make them recommend the product to their friend, if they’ve recommended it to any yet.

### You should make this feedback loop as tight as possible.

### You should try to keep this going for all of your company’s life, but it’s really important in the early days.

### Great founders don’t put anyone between themselves and their users.

### It’s critical to get this loop embedded in the culture.

## ANSWER TO YOUR METRICS

### You really need to use metrics to keep yourself honest on this.

### It really is true that the company will build whatever the CEO decides to measure.

### If you’re building an Internet service, ignore things like total registrations.

### Look at growth in active users, activity levels, cohort retention, revenue, net promoter scores, these things that matter.

### Be brutally honest if your metrics aren’t going in the right direction.

### Startups live on growth, it’s the indicator of a great product.
