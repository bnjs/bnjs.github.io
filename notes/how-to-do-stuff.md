This is an exercise in hyper-opinionatedness. I'm going to try to capture every opinion I have about how to do stuff.

<h2>Living</h2>

<br>

<h3 id="how-to-buy-a-mattress">How to buy a mattress</h3>

Buy a <a href="https://casper.com" target="_blank">Casper</a>. Don't get a boxspring or frame, just put it on the floor.

<br>

<h3 id="how-to-make-money">How to make money</h3>

Be humble <em>and</em> tough, make yourself useful, work hard, then make yourself valuable. All of that is infinitely easier when it's something you love doing.

<br>


<h2>Study</h2>

<br>

<h3 id="how-to-really-learn-a-language">How to really learn a language</h3>

Forget everything you know from your native language. Develop a strong auditory familiarity with the language you want to learn. Train your ability to hear an utterance once and retain an echo of the sounds in memory (even if you don't know what it means). Train your ability to do this with longer and longer utterances. Anything you say should be based on something you've heard, or very straightforward combinations of simple words and structures you've mastered. Delay reading/writing as long as you possibly can; you will unconsciously pronounce words like your native language, poluting the phonetic integrity of the target language in your brain.

<h2>Entertainment</h2>

<br>

<h3 id="how-to-watch-star-wars">How to watch Star Wars</h3>

Watch Star Wars in the <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/" target="_blank">Machete Order</a>. UPDATE: <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2015/12/28/machete-order-update-and-faq/" target="_blank">Update and FAQ</a>.

<h3 id="how-to-watch-sports">How to watch sports</h3>

Don't watch sports, except FIFA World Cup every 4 years and watch as many games as you can.

<br>

<h3 id="how-to-appreciate-movies">How to appreciate movies</h3>

Start with the American Film Institute's 1994 ranking "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies" target="_blank">100 Years... 100 Movies</a>." Then move on to the list of the <a href="http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/movies400.pdf" target="_blank">400 nominated movies</a>. Do not acknowledge the 2007 re-ranking; it's wrong.
