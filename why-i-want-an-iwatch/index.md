# Why I Want an iWatch

The possibility of an iWatch announcement at WWDC on September 9th has me thinking about the rumored device and all the things I want to do with it. In this post I'll go over those things. No features have been confirmed of course, so this is all speculation and wishful thinking. Still, I think the device has amazing potential.

### Time

I want to tell time of course. I'd like to see:

* a beautiful animated watch face
* several different default watch faces to choose from (like backgrounds), including both digital and analog styles
* downloadable watch faces on the AppStore from my favorite brands and talented developers/designers
* using a gyroscopic sensor, display automatically turns on when in a position visible to me, and off when not in a position visible to me.

### Not have to use my iPhone

I want to have basic control over my iPhone while it sits in my pocket or bag. This is huge to me. Squeezing my hand into my pocket (1), pulling out my phone (2), turning it on (3). Three steps just to check the time or notification. Slide the lock (4) and enter my password (5), open an app (6+). Six or more steps just to check the weather, read an email, look at a web page, check my todo list, look at my calendar, read or reply to a message, look at a photo, etc. When I'm done, I turn it off (7+) and put it back in my pocket (8+). Every time. This is insane.

With an iWatch. Turn it toward me to see the lock screen (watch face or new notifications) (<1?). That's hardly even a step, to check the date/time or read an incoming message/notification. Three steps on iPhone down to barely one on iWatch.

Slide or tap the screen to unlock (2). Now I'm in* and can use the watch (3+). I'm done so I put my hand down and it automatically turns off (4+). If you count lifting your hand as half a step, that's best-case only three steps to open an app and put the watch away. Best-case eight steps on iPhone down to best-case three on iWatch. That is a significant improvement in my opinion, multiplied by all the times you do something on your phone that you could easily do on a watch.

I want iWatch to be a remote control and alternative display for my iPhone. This is the fundamental feature for me. Almost everything I want to do on the watch, I want to because it would save me time and effort. Health monitoring and all that is cool too, but it's secondary to this.

\* I wouldn't use a password because I'm not likely to lose something strapped to my wrist, and I'm assuming most sensitive content would live on my phone and be accessed via bluetooth.

### Notifications

I want to see push notifications from apps on my iPhone.

### Emails and messages

I want to 

* see messages and emails in full (swipe or scroll to read more)
* compose messages with my voice, or
* scroll/swipe to select from common phrases to send ("hi", "ok", "thanks", "yes", "no", etc.), or
* send a voice message

### Phone

I want to make calls and talk through my watch! Facetime capability if there's a little camera on the front, for bonus points.

### Camera

I'm not a big selfie-taker personally, but I could see this being a very popular use-case. Hold your watch up like you'd hold a camera selfie-style, and say "Cheese" to take the shot. Super fast selfies.

### Music

My music will live on my iPhone and play on my iPhone and I'll listen with headphones connected to my iPhone, but I want full music controls on my watch: pause, play, previous/next track, volume, even browsing my library and selecting tracks.

### Maps

I might use my phone to search and select a destination, but once I'm on my way I want my watch to point me in the right direction like a futuristic compass.

### The obvious widget apps

Weather, timer, stocks, calculator, calendar, photos, voice memos.

### Voice memos

Did I say voice memos? Voice memos! "Note to self: this is really easy."

### Other Apps

Last but not least, any iOS app should be able to ship with a custom iWatch interface for some degree of functionality on the watch. Most apps should at least have something for you to browse and look at without having to get out your phone, and I imagine many apps would be very usable on a small screen interface, some completely usable.

I'm sure I'm forgetting some. I'll be adding to the list as I think of more things I want!
