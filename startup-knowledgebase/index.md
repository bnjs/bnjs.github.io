*ACCOUNTING*<br/>
<a href="http://avc.com/2010/03/accounting/" style="font-weight:bold">Accounting</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-03-08

> Accounting is keeping track of the money in a company. It's critical to keep good books and records for a business, no matter how small it is. I'm not going to lay out exactly how to do that, but I am going to discuss a few important principals.

*ACCOUNTING*<br/>
<a href="http://avc.com/2010/04/analyzing-financial-statements/" style="font-weight:bold">Analyzing Financial Statements</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-04-05

> In the past three weeks, we talked about the three main financial statements, the Income Statement, the Balance Sheet, and the Cash Flow Statement. This post is going to attempt to help you figure out how to analyze them, at least at a cursory level.

*ACCOUNTING*<br/>
<a href="http://avc.com/2010/03/cash-flow/" style="font-weight:bold">Cash Flow</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-03-29

> Cash flow is the amount of cash your business either produces or consumes in a given period, typically a month, quarter, or year. You might think that is the same as the profit of the business, but that is not correct for a bunch of reasons.

*ACCOUNTING*<br/>
<a href="http://avc.com/2010/03/the-balance-sheet/" style="font-weight:bold">The Balance Sheet</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-03-22

> The Balance Sheet is a report of the asset and liability accounts. Assets are things you own in your business, like cash, capital equipment, and money that is owed to you for products and services you have delivered to customers. Liabilities are obligations of the business, like bills you have yet to pay, money you have borrowed from a bank or investors.

*ACCOUNTING*<br/>
<a href="http://avc.com/2010/03/the-profit-and-loss-statement/" style="font-weight:bold">The Profit and Loss Statement</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-03-15

> Today on MBA Mondays we are going to talk about one of the most important things in business, the profit and loss statement (also known as the P&L). Picking up from the accounting post last week, there are two kinds of accounting entries; those that describe money coming into and out of your business, and money that is contained in your business. The P&L deals with the first category.

*BUDGETING*<br/>
<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/budgeting-in-a-growing-company.html" style="font-weight:bold">Budgeting In A Growing Company</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-05-24

> What happens to the budgeting process once revenues start coming in, headcount gets to between 50 and 100 employees, and you are now a full fledged high growth business?

*BUDGETING*<br/>
<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/budgeting-in-a-large-company.html" style="font-weight:bold">Budgeting In A Large Company</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2013-10-02

> The budgeting process is really critical in a large company. It forces the company to make highly informed decisions about investments and resource allocation and it creates company wide discipline around hitting goals. I have never seen a company of 150 employees or more operate functionally without a strong budget process.

*BUDGETING*<br/>
<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/05/budgeting-in-a-small-early-stage-company.html" style="font-weight:bold">Budgeting In A Small Early Stage Company</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-05-10

> The first step in budgeting is to review the key business metrics and lock them down based on what is realistic for the next year. Be very realistic. A good budget is a conservative budget.

*BURN*<br/>
<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/12/burn-rate.html" style="font-weight:bold">Burn Rate</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-12-05

> Your burn rate is the speed at which your cash balance is going down. If you had $1mm in cash on January 1st, and now it is October 1st and you have $250,000 left, your burn rate is $750,000/9, or $83,333/month.

*MARGINS*<br/>
<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/04/margins.html" style="font-weight:bold">Margins</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-04-11

> Margin is the amount of money you make on each incremental sale or unit of revenue before factoring in the "fixed costs" of your business. Fixed costs would be things like the rent on your office, your administrative team, and the people who do your accounting/bookeeping work for you. The key concept to wrap your head around is some costs rise and fall based on how much revenue you have and some costs are fixed and are the "cost of keeping the doors open.

*MARGINS*<br/>
<a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/04/margins-continued.html" style="font-weight:bold">Margins (continued)</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-04-18

> I like to focus on "gross margin" because I think it tells you a lot about the scalability of a business (as I detailed in last week's post). But operating margin which is gross margin less all the operating costs is another really important metric.

<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-10-12

> Many first-time entrepreneurs form advisory boards and grant 0.25-0.5% equity to each adviser.  Should you?  This post talks about why equity for advisers should only come if they write a check and if you do set up an advisory board what the best way to run it is.  Also a quick note on how VCs view advisory boards (summary answer is – we’re cynical).

### Business: Early Stage <small><a href="#">top</a></small>

<a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/sean-ellis-interview" style="font-weight:bold">How to Bring a Product to Market / A Very Rare Interview with Sean Ellis - by Babak Nivi</a>
<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2009-12-14

> In an early stage startup you have an opportunity to put a product out there, get that initial user feedback, and then you have two choices. If that feedback is really strong and the users say that they’d be very disappointed without it, in a large percentage, then you can try to grow the business. Alternatively, if they come back and say that they wouldn’t be that disappointed without the product, then you have the choices where you can either try to grow it or you can decide that you’re not going to try and grow the business. And to me, my recommendation has always been to decide not to grow the business if it doesn’t have a lot of people that are real passionate about the solutions.

<a href="http://venturehacks.com/articles/sean-ellis-interview-2" style="font-weight:bold">How to Bring a Product to Market, Part 2 — After Product/Market Fit</a>
<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2010-01-12

> Here, Sean Ellis explains what you do after fit: optimizing your positioning, implementing a business model, and optimizing your funnel — all so you’re prepared to acquire users quickly and profitably.

<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-06-02

> Getting product right means finding product market fit. It does not mean launching the product. It means getting to the point where the market accepts your product and wants more of it. That means different things in consumer, saas, infrastructure, hardware, etc, but in every case you must get to product market fit before thinking about anything else. And, I believe, moving to business model before finding product market fit can be the worst thing for your business.

*INCORPORATION*<br/>
<a href="http://www.avc.com/2010/02/corporate-entity/" style="font-weight:bold">Corporate Entities</a>
<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2010-02-22

> There are many people who run a business and don't incorporate. A good example of this are many of the sellers on Etsy. They make things, sell them, receive the income, and pay the taxes as part of their personal returns. But there are three big reasons you'll want to consider incorporating; liability, taxes, and investment. And the kind of corporate entity you create depends on where you want to come out on all three of those factors.

Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-08-17

> I often talk with entrepreneurs who are kicking around their next idea.  Sometimes they’re working full time at a company or sometimes they’ve already left their employer and they’re bouncing around ideas with friends.  These periods of time can leave a founder very vulnerable in the future.

<br/>
Mark Suster - bothsidesofthetable.com - 2009-11-19

> I believe that being successful as an entrepreneur requires you to get lots of things done.  You are constantly faced with decisions and there is always incomplete information.  This paralyzes most people.  Not you. Entrepreneurs make fast decisions and move forward knowing that at best 70% of their decisions are going to be right.  They move the ball forward every day.  They are quick to spot their mistakes and correct.  Good entrepreneurs can admit when their course of action was wrong and learn from it.  Good entrepreneurs are wrong often.  If you’re not then you’re not trying hard enough.  Good entrepreneurs have a penchant for doing vs. over-analyzing.  (obviously don’t read this as zero analysis).

> Best case scenario in my mind is just 1, but at most I recommend 2. I knew this topic would be controversial because when I tell people this in person it always elicits shock.   To be clear – it is not about being stingy with or hoarding equity – it is about having a prenuptial agreement.

Chris Dixon - cdixon.org - 2009-04-21

> The most important term in a startup term sheet that no one seems to think carefully about is founder vesting. There are two key points about vesting: 1) All startup employees – including founders! – should vest over 4 years from their start date (with a one year “cliff”). 2) Founders should always have acceleration on change of control!

<br/>
Paul Graham - paulgraham.com - 2013-08-01

> So here's the recipe for impressing investors when you're not already good at seeming formidable: Make something worth investing in. Understand why it's worth investing in. Explain that clearly to investors. If you're saying something you know is true, you'll seem confident when you're saying it. Conversely, never let pitching draw you into bullshitting. As long as you stay on the territory of truth, you're strong. Make the truth good, then just tell it.

[Product distribution] How does the company acquire customers cost effectively? What are the unit economics (customer acquisition cost, contribution revenue, and churn rates)?  [Revenue model] Does the company have the revenue model to build a big (>$100M annual revenue) business with good margins (gross ~ 50 to 60% / net ~15 to 25%) under reasonable assumptions?

> The first thing to do is to dispel the belief that the best product always wins. There is a rich history of instances where the best product did not, in fact, win. Nikola Tesla invented the alternating current electrical supply system. It was, for a variety of reasons, technologically better than the direct current system that Thomas Edison developed. Tesla was the better scientist. But Edison was the better businessman, and he went on to start GE. Interestingly, Tesla later developed the idea of radio transmission. But Marconi took it from him and then won the Nobel Prize. Inspiration isn’t all that counts. The best product may not win.

You won't even make it off the launch pad without fuel. But that myopic view misses out on the larger purpose and mission of the machine. Certainly some businesses really are about nothing more than making money, but among the truly significant founders I've known, there's always a larger purpose. It's not just a nihilistic pursuit of rocket fuel.

To combat this problem, Rosenstein says, leaders need to prioritize clarity in everything they do in this order: Clarity of purpose; clarity of plan; and clarity of responsibility. If you can marry these three qualities, you can achieve organizational fluidity that will get the most out of your resources.

> The limits of a completely flat approach, as conceded by Valve, reveal the mental trap that is causing startups to reject management. With the reference to the military at the beginning, Valve makes it clear that they see management solely through the lens of command and control hierarchies: it’s there to establish bureaucracy in the name of consistency and order. This can be true, but need not be, and definitely should not be the only role that management plays. Instead, I think the most important value of a manager is to serve their reports: to unblock them, mentor them, and keep them pointed in a direction that best serves their needs and the priorities of the organization.

> Building product is not about having a large team to manage. It is about having a small team with the right people on it. You need product, design, and software engineering skills on the team. And you need to be focused, committed, and driven. Management at this point is all about small team dynamics; everyone on board, working together, and getting stuff done. Strong individual contributors are key in this stage. Management skills are not a requirement. In fact they may even be a hindrance.

> Many founders are naturally talented at building product and building the user base. But building the company comes harder to them. I once discussed this with Roelof Bothaand he made a fantastic suggestion. Founders should think of the business as yet another product they are building. It is the ultimate product they are building because from the company can come any number of additional products and any number of additional initiatives. The company, if built correctly, will be more important than any single product it can create.

They make things, sell them, receive the income, and pay the taxes as part of their personal returns. But there are three big reasons you'll want to consider incorporating; liability, taxes, and investment. And the kind of corporate entity you create depends on where you want to come out on all three of those factors.

> Forming a company is the best way to "putting a buffer between you and the business." But you can't just pretend to be a business, you have to be a business. "Being a business" means separating your personal and business records, separating your personal and business bank accounts, treating the business as a real entity, having board meetings, taking board minutes, doing major activities via board resolutions, following "due process." If you don't behave as a real business, you could find yourself in a situation where someone, most commonly someone who is suing your business, can come after you (and your business partners) personally. And then you are going to say "but what about the liability limitation the business provides?" It may not be there for you.

> I know that people have an allergy to lawyers out of fear of being screwed.  Much of this is unfounded – some is not.  If you’re a startup and you don’t have a close relationship with a few law firms you’re really missing one of the most important relationships that any entrepreneur can have. This all got me thinking about a post on how to best work with lawyers.  This is stuff I tell people verbally at least twice / month so I’m glad to finally get it into written format.

<br/>
Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2008-06-12

> Lawyers teach you the rules of the game. But they usually can’t teach you how to play it. Lawyers say whether you can do something, within the confines of the law and your existing contracts. Lawyers will also write the contracts and do the filings. But they usually can’t tell you what to do—that’s what coaches do. A lawyer knows that you’re not breaking any laws or contracts if you give a common board seat to a new CEO. He also knows how to write the contract. But an advisor knows the possible outcomes of that decision.

<br/>
Bill Gurley - abovethecrowd.com - 2014-07-11

> So here is the objective of this post. It is not my aim to specifically convince anyone that Uber is worth any specific valuation. What Professor Damodaran thinks, or what anyone who is not a buyer or seller of stocks thinks, is fairly immaterial. I am also not out to prove him wrong. I am much more interested in the subject of critical reasoning and predictions, and how certain assumptions can lead to gravely different outcomes. As such, my goal is to offer a plausible argument that the core assumptions used in Damodaran’s analysis may be off by a factor of 25 times, perhaps even more. And I hope the analysis is judged on whether the arguments I make are reasonable and feasible.

Brekiri - brekiri.com - 2010-02-26

> Like forecasts, market size estimates should most often be considered directional (consulting speak for 'in the right ballpark'). You should also keep this point in mind when consuming market size information – the market size numbers you read in the news or market research reports are probably only accurate within 10-20% in many cases.  One of the best ways to ensure that you get at least a sensible result is to triangulate between different approaches: top-down and bottom-up estimates.

The most important factor to increasing growth is not the Viral Coefficient, but the Viral Cycle Time (ct) which should be made as short as possible. This will have a dramatic effect on growth. 3. The second most important area to focus is the Viral Coefficient (K). Anything that you can do to increase the number of invitations sent out, and the conversion rate, will have a significant effect on growth.

To succeed, you need to design and test constantly throughout both marketing and product. Marketers must design and test multiple channels, measuring effectiveness deep down the funnel rather than on the surface. Product designers should rigorously test new features through split testing and measuring impact on conversion.

<br/>
Tom Blomfield - tomblomfield.com - 2014-07-10

> Startups are about growth, and of all the different possible metrics, startups often focus on user growth - if people aren’t using your new product or service in greater and greater numbers, it’s a good sign that you’re not on the right track. And, as long as your business-model is solid, user growth is a leading indicator of revenue and profit growth. But there’s another key metric that can be the making of your company, or the death of it - churn, or the proportion of existing customers who become ex-customers during a period of time (generally a year).

*CHURN*<br/>

> Churn rates and LTV are challenging to predict with accuracy and while rules of thumb like the formulas above may be reasonable guidelines, it's important to be aware of their tendency to overestimate lifetime value [...]. Because a 2x overestimate of customer lifetime can radically change a startup's unit economics, deeply understanding churn behaviors is crucial to making a startup's business model viable.

> Getting product right means finding product market fit. It does not mean launching the product. It means getting to the point where the market accepts your product and wants more of it.

And, I believe, moving to business model before finding product market fit can be the worst thing for your business.

> I would break up advertising into two big buckets; ads that are sold and ads that are bought. The first is a relationship business, requires a direct salesforce or a salesforce that you can tap into, and will bring a higher revenue per impression in most cases. The latter is a data business, automated by machines and software, is a volume game and will bring a lower revenue per impression in most cases. Much of the online advertising market is moving inexorably toward the latter category, for good and bad.

> Today, most software is sold in a subscription model. You pay a monthly fee for the right to use the software. If you stop paying the monthly fee, your right to use the software goes away. Maintenance and support is bundled in. The emergence of the subscription model has made the software business better. In the old upfront license fee model, software companies would trade at 2-4x revenues. Now they trade at 6-8x revenues. That reflects the recurring, almost annuity nature of the subscription model.

Although I think Steve has a stricter definition of what achieving Product/Market fit looks like than Sean.

> I believe that the life of any startup can be divided into two parts: before product/market fit (call this 'BPMF') and after product/market fit ('APMF'). When you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit.

Startups require a solid foundation of product/market fit before progressing up the pyramid and scaling the business.

> My central argument is that if you believe that every startup is an iterative learning process that converges towards product/market fit, then you need extremely high-fidelity signals to tell you if you’re going in the right direction. That means that along with trying to charge people money from early on, which is the highest form of “I love this!” you should give people valves to tell you “I hate this!” so that you can learn more faster.

> A few months ago, I spoke to a group of entrepreneurs at Stanford whose seed stage companies were still struggling to get product/market fit. I wrote down a few thoughts on the topic and turned it into slides. It’s really an extended version of this essay from 2011, but incorporates some newer thinking based on stuff I’ve learned in the meantime.

> I add a customer development specialist when the Validation Step begins, which is the role I fill with startups. I belive eventually many people will specialize in this critical stage.  Without a specialist, startups waste critical time and resources deciding where to execute. It’s surprising how similiar the process of uncovering the critical information needed to drive customer adoption across different types of startups.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2011-10-24

> I generally encourage companies to wait as long as possible to bring on a CFO. Great CFOs are few and far between. And in order to recruit one of them, you will need an interesting business and a meaty role. VP Finance talent is in larger supply and they can take you very far. Get a VP Finance onboard as soon as you can afford one. They will let you sleep at night. Get a CFO on board when you are ready to take on the world. You can't do that without a strong one at your side.

<br/>
Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-01-02

> Building product is not about having a large team to manage. It is about having a small team with the right people on it. You need product, design, and software engineering skills on the team. And you need to be focused, committed, and driven. Management at this point is all about small team dynamics; everyone on board, working together, and getting stuff done. Strong individual contributors are key in this stage. Management skills are not a requirement. In fact they may even be a hindrance.

Fred Wilson - avc.com - 2012-01-16

> Many founders are naturally talented at building product and building the user base. But building the company comes harder to them. I once discussed this with Roelof Bothaand he made a fantastic suggestion. Founders should think of the business as yet another product they are building. It is the ultimate product they are building because from the company can come any number of additional products and any number of additional initiatives. The company, if built correctly, will be more important than any single product it can create.

Babak Nivi - venturehacks.com - 2013-02-11

> AngelList “corporate policy” is that team members should ask forgiveness, not permission. We would rather have someone do something wrong than ask permission to do it. Or better, we would rather have someone do something right and not need permission to do it. This is the most common outcome. We would rather have people ship to production whenever they want, than go through an internal review process. We can fix it on production. We prefer the customer’s review process. And it isn’t too hard to reveal a new feature to a small portion of our users and iterate on it as we expand it to more users.

> We use very little email at AngelList. Most of our communication happens on Yammer, HipChat, Tracker and face-to-face. This probably gets us a 90% reduction in email. If you’re running your company via email, you’re missing out on newer, more effective communications technologies.

*COMMUNICATION*<br/>

<br/>
Marshall Rosenberg - en.wikipedia.org

> Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

A few more are going to have strong outcomes and return it again. The rest are noise when it comes to fund returns (but you better not treat them like noise).

> So there you have it: a simple set of naming conventions for more modular CSS. Again, for my own method I've borrowed a lot from SMACSS, BEM, and OOCSS. If you're not familiar with any of these approaches they are well worth reading up on. You don't have to do modular CSS the way I do. Some folks prefer to use different types of separators to distiguish between different types of classes. But the core of the approach outlined here is common between the major methodologies.

### Development: Data <small><a href="#">top</a></small>

<br/>
Jean-Philippe Boily - blog.rainforestqa.com - 2014-06-27

> All developers will at some time or other have to deploy code that changes the structure of a database. You might have downtime during these deploys due to database changes being required by the new code that you just deployed. There are easy ways to work around those downtimes and provide you a real zero downtime deployment process.

*MONITORING*<br/>

<br/>
Joe Stanton - red-badger.com - 2013-11-04

> Everyone knows you need data to make decisions. If you’re developing software of any sort, quick access to metrics can enable you to answer important questions like this: Is your app working? If not, which piece of your infrastructure specifically broke? Which areas need performance optimization? Do you need to scale? What was the impact of your recent code deployment? Do your users care? At development time, we can get all of the data we need, we use it for debugging, performance optimization etc. but what good is data if it’s not real-world? Things that should be true in 2013: Pushing your app to production shouldn’t mean a loss of insight. We should be able to measure everything, at all layers of the stack. We should get infrastructure and application monitoring by default. We should be able to visualise that data quickly and easily, so we can use it to solve problems and make informed decisions.

<br/>
Evan Miller - evanmiller.org - 2010-04-18

> Although they seem powerful and convenient, dashboard views of ongoing A/B experiments invite misuse. Any time they are used in conjunction with a manual or automatic “stopping rule,” the resulting significance tests are simply invalid. Until sequential or Bayesian experiment designs are implemented in software, anyone running web experiments should only run experiments where the sample size has been fixed in advance, and stick to that sample size with near-religious discipline.

Mike Brittain - codeascraft.com - 2010-12-08

> Automated tracking of code deploys is essential for teams who practice Continuous Deployment. Monitoring every aspect of your server and network architecture helps detect when something has gone awry. Correlating the times of each and every code deploy helps to quickly identify human-triggered problems and greatly cut down on your time to resolve them.

*RSPEC*<br/>

> RSpec is a great tool in the behavior-driven development (BDD) process of writing human readable specifications that direct and validate the development of your application. On the web there are many resources that give complete overview of _what_ you can do with RSpec. But there are fewer resources devoted to how to create a great RSpec test suite. Better Specs tries to fill this gap by collecting most of the best practices" that other developers learn through years of experience."

<br/>
Marshall Rosenberg - en.wikipedia.org

> Nonviolent Communication holds that most conflicts between individuals or groups arise from miscommunication about their human needs, due to coercive or manipulative language that aims to induce fear, guilt, shame, etc. These "violent" modes of communication, when used during a conflict, divert the attention of the participants away from clarifying their needs, their feelings, their perceptions, and their requests, thus perpetuating the conflict.

> When I write a blog post, I tend to write it as the idea forms in my brain. I write the whole thing out. And then I rewrite it. I go over every line and make sure the spelling and grammar are correct, I look at the phrasing. I consider the flow. I read it start to finish at least three or four times. I think about the whole and then each part. And I’ll cut out paragraphs, move things, rewrite parts, and mess with it for almost as long as it took me to write it in the first place.
