Hey there,

A few things about me:

- grew up in the Boston area
- first love was computers (Apple IIE, Macintosh, Monkey Island, BASIC)
- received no formal education between 6th grade and college
- second love was movies (AFI's ["100 Years... 100 Movies"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies))
- third love was philosophy and language (Japanese, German)
- studied abroad in Japan (Summer '04 Hokkaido, Summer '05 Shiga, '05-'06 Hokkaido on MEXT scholarship)
- worked in Tokyo for 8 years (3 years teaching English, 5 in software and startups)
- cofounded and built <a href="http://www.tadaku.com" target="_blank">Tadaku</a> (Tokyo, acquired 2015)
- currently a Technical Lead Manager at <a href="https://www.instacart.com/" target="_blank">Instacart</a> in San Francisco

I like to solve hard problems and build things that make an impact.
