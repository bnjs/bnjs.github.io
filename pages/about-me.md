Here's a little bit about myself.

\- I'm currently living in San Francisco.<br>
\- Previously I lived in Tokyo for about 8 years.<br>
\- Originally from Boston.<br>

<br>

## My Work

I like to solve hard problems and build things that make an impact.

\- Technical Lead/Manager at <a href="https://www.instacart.com/" target="_blank">Instacart</a>.<br>
\- Cofounded and built <a href="http://www.tadaku.com" target="_blank">Tadaku</a> (acquired in 2015).

<br>

## Random Things

\- When it comes to food, I don't subscribe to the philosophy of "save the best for last." Given a set of flavor choices, I will start with the best first. This way I am always experiencing maximum value relative to my available options.

\- I believe in an objective reality that is hard to know beyond a minimal level of depth without a considerable degree of effort and humility.
