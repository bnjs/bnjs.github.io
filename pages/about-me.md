## My Story

(in a nutshell)

I grew up in the Boston area.

My first love was computers. I started out on my dad's Apple IIE and later Macintosh. Playing [Monkey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island) is my fondest memory from childhood. My dad paid a local cash-strapped comp-sci student to teach me programming in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) when I was 9.

My parents took me out of school in the 6th grade and uprooted our family to a rural country town. (I wouldn't end up going back to school until college.) I was extremely lonely during most of my adolescence.

My second love was movies. I consider the AFI's 1994 ["100 Years... 100 Movies"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years...100_Movies) ranking definitive. When I was 15 I seriously thought I would go into film-making and apprenticed on a couple of local low-budget productions.

My third love was language and philosophy. When I was 16 I started studying Japanese because it seemed hard and I was obsessed with a video game called [Shenmue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenmue). I studied <em>kanji</em> every day at Starbucks. I was also obsessed with traditional Japanese arts and culture. [MOFA Boston](http://www.mfa.org/)'s Japan Exhibit was a favorite hangout spot. I chose Japanese Language & Literature as my major in college.

My first trip to Japan was a summer program in Hokkaido as a sophomore in '04. I spent the next summer in Shiga prefecture in '05, and got a [MEXT-Japan](http://www.mext.go.jp/english/) scholarship to study at Hokkaido University from '05 to '06. After graduating college in the States in '07, I returned again to begin a new life as an English teacher in Tokyo.

I spent 2 years hating my job, which was at once soul-crushing and the most motivating experience of my life (to leave). I took fewer hours, scraped by, and busted my ass to catch up on software and the web. Landing my first job writing code was a top 5 happiest moment in my life, and the start of an exciting career in technology and startups.

I spent nearly 8 years living and working in Japan between '07 and '15. I had no friends or acquaintances when I arrived, and went home only once in those 8 years after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. I got lost, got married, made brothers-worth of friends, did stupid things,  a few awesome things, grew up and got my shit together, and learned the meaning of humility, respect, hangover, participation, care, hard-work. My fourth love was Japan.

Today I live with my wife in San Francisco.

## Random Things

\- When it comes to food, I don't subscribe to the philosophy of "save the best for last." Given a set of flavor choices, I will start with the best first. This way I am always experiencing maximum value relative to my available options.

\- I believe in an objective reality that is hard to know beyond a minimal level of depth without a considerable degree of effort and humility.
