## I. Things to do

In a typical person's life, there are a lot of things to do (or not do). I divide them into 5 or 3 types.

The first two types are no-brainers. 1. Things you have to do: work, school, keeping appointments, paying bills. You just do them. Easy. 2. Things you don't enjoy doing and that are also not good for you. You just don't do them. Easy.

The types of things I want to talk about, though, are three types that people have the most trouble with:

1. Things you enjoy doing that are easy, and often not especially good for you. Examples: eating junk food, watching TV, playing video games.

2. Things you enjoy doing that take some effort. Examples: a personal project, learning a new interesting skill, cooking a nice meal.

3. Things you don't enjoy doing, but are good for you. Examples: eating healthy, exercise, washing the dishes, other delayable chores.

Different people will have different examples, but however it breaks down everyone has these three types of things and each of them is good for you to some degree. The challenge is getting the right balance and sustaining it, for an optimally satisfying life over the long-term.

Let's look a little closer. "Things you enjoy doing that are easy" -- These aren't bad *per se* but they don't add substantial value to your life and they may be in fact bad for you in large doses.

On the other end, "Things you don't enjoy doing but are good for you" -- You might enjoy doing these a little bit, or trick yourself into enjoying them, or feel glad about doing them after the fact, but you generally don't do them for purely self-indulgent reasons. It's an investment of time and effort for a certain longer term or less obvious return.

Finally "things you enjoy doing that take effort" -- These fall somewhere in between. They aren't easy and may offer considerable value to your life; maybe you become exceptionally skilled at it and can start doing it professionally. But you also honestly enjoy it.


## II. Laziness

Laziness is this thing where you're doing too much of the easy things you enjoy doing, and not enough of anything else. What makes it a thing is that it's a feedback loop, a viscious circle. Not only do you get very little important stuff done, but it's tiring. In some ways it's more tiring than work or doing things you don't enjoy, because you feel guilty about it.

You're lazy and you feel guilty about being lazy and that makes you tired, and that makes it hard to stop being lazy. You find yourself playing a procrastination game that you're designed to lose: "I should probably do this today, should I do it today? I guess I could do it tomorrow. When should I do it? Before dinner or after?" You have a lot of choices and no clear way to make a decision. That's tiring, and the easy decision is not doing it at all.

You're in a lazy rut and it's hard to get out. It takes a certain amount of energy to achieve escape velocity, and you're running on reserves. You have to gather all your resources and burst out in one shot.


## III. Standards

I like standards (or principles, or rules). The reason I like standards is because they make hard things easy. You don't have to think about a standard -- you're not supposed to -- you just do it because it's a standard. It's the same for going to work or keeping a promise or paying your bills. You could decide to not do these things, you'd probably survive, but you do them because they are part of a basic standard of life that is good for you, and in that way it's easy.

This brings us to the subject of this post, a simple rule for staying productive. It's a standard, and it really is simple:

<h3><blockquote>
<br/>Do (at least) one thing that you don't enjoy, every day.
<br/>
<br/>
</blockquote></h3>

That's it. A simple standard. If you already do one, then make it two. But do no less than one.

These are the positive effects:

* those things get done at a steady rate of at least one per day
* it wakes you up and puts you in productive mode
* the relative difficulty of "things you enjoy doing that take effort" is lower
* the relative boringness of "things you enjoy doing that are easy" is higher
* you feel good about yourself and stay out of the laziness rut


## IV. Accountability

These types of rules are great and there are thousands of them for all kinds of goals, but they are meaningless if you don't do them and keep them. How do you hold yourself accountable? Here are some tips:

* a paper calendar with an X on each day, hard to miss
* a recurring event on Google Calendar with a reminder
* a recurring task on a todo-list app with a reminder
* a reminder/alarm on your phone
* social pressure (a big part of [Kenzai](https://kenzai.me)), make it a thing you talk about with your friends

Once you get the habit off the ground, it will start to become a natural part of your life.
