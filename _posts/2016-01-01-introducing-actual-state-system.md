title: Introducing Actual State System

*Actual State System is a system for sustaining a mental state optimal for achieving goals.*

Every year, millions of people make New Years resolutions for goals they want to achieve in the New Year. Making goals is easy. The abismal failure to actually achieve them is so common it's basically [an](http://imgur.com/8Pd9zTS) [Internet](http://imgur.com/a/LxM3t) [meme](http://imgur.com/cIP6dze).

**Achieving goals is hard.**

Today we're going to find out why, and we're going to fix it.

## 1

Let's start with a definition. What is a goal? A goal is a future reward that seems attainable in exchange for an investment of effort that seems worthwhile.

The first step to understanding why achieving goals is hard and fixing it is to realize that **you are a collection of mental states rotating turns at controlling your mind**. When you're hungry, tired, bored, excited, restless, these mental states activate and make you do stuff.

Why does this matter? Back to our definition of a goal -- "an investment of effort that seems worthwhile." This is an evaluation made by *one* of your mental states about a cost of effort that will probably need to be paid at times *when other mental states are active*.

For a small group of people this heightened, goal-oriented mental state is constantly active by nature. They are lucky and rare. For everyone else (myself included) it will be at least partly a problem of engineering.

So unfortunately your mind is a runaway carriage and lots of different mental states with different inclinations get a turn at the reigns. That's pretty bad if there was some specific place in the distance that you wanted this carriage to go. That's why achieving significant goals is hard.

On the other hand, you've got this one mental state that thinks about long-term investments you could realistically make to substantially improve your life. This mental state is so confident that it commits to these goals on behalf of your other mental states, and for a little while even motivates them to go along. This is good. Really good.

Our second step is to realize that **this mental state is your supreme guide**. You entrust it with the betterment of your life. You feel guilty when you've gone astray. This mental state has an *a priori* natural right to rule your mind. It does, and you know it does. If you don't, you can stop reading here.

If you're still here, congratulations, your mind has a sovereign mental state that is aware of its natural right to rule. I call it Actual State.

Now you should notice that Actual State is at least partly active in your mind right now. We woke it up in step 2.

The third step is to realize that **Actual State is activated when you're confronted with the undeniable truth that Actual State is supreme**. Various events in your life lead you to this truth indirectly -- hearing about a successful person, being confronted with your own lack of effort, starting a new year -- but you can also just see it in plain English.

>You know you should have goals. You know you should have a strategy for achieving them. You know you should be executing your strategy and seeing results toward achieving your goals. You know this is right.

This is Actual State in words. Reading it should activate it, and set you on the right course. I think of it as a declaration of sovereignty.

Let's pause and recap. You are a collection of mental states, one of which has a natural right to rule your mind that you already acknowledge, and by thinking about it you can activate it in your mind.

The last step is to make Actual State a permanent fixture in your life. This is where it gets real:

**Stake a territorial claim on a physical environment where you spend a lot of time, in your home or office or both. Print [this document](http://www.actualstate.com) and post it on your wall.**

This document is Actual State System. It describes the system, and it is the physical mechanism that makes the system work. When you post it on your wall you will be confronted by it constantly. When you see it you will recall Actual State and know that it is right. You will think about your goals and if you don't have any *you will feel bad*. You will think about your strategy for achieving your goals and if you don't have one *you will feel bad*. You will think about whether you are executing your strategy and if you're not *you will feel bad*. You will think about whether you are producing results toward achieving your goals and if you're not *you will feel bad*.

This is a window of opportunity to seriously level up. And it's just the tip of the iceberg. This is bare-bones Actual State System. In practice you can take it to incredible lengths. You just need to take the first step.

Welcome to sustained Actual State. You are now in control of a human being. The future is at the mercy of your design.
