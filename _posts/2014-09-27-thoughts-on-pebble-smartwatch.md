title: Thoughts on Pebble Smartwatch
---

I've been using the Pebble smartwatch for a few days. My suspicion that there is a layer of personal computing that really belongs on a watch is confirmed.

The most obvious examples on this layer are notifications and date/time. *These alone justify the device in my case.* I get dozens of notifications per day.

Music control and "widget" applications (timer, weather, stocks, reminders, calendar, calculator) also feel very natural on a watch. Minimal necessary interaction (limited by device UI) and compactness of information (limited by screen size) are the key factors. There's a hard limit on screen size for a watch, but UI improvements beyond Pebble's simple 4-button approach could broaden the scope of watch-layer functionality going forward (touchscreen, Apple's digital crown). Just how far this layer can be stretched will be seen.

For now, the Pebble is becoming an indispensible part my personal computing experience. Many people are understandably skeptical of yet more technological intrusion in their daily life with wearable tech, but this skepticism has been counter-intuitively wrong in my experience with Pebble. I'm using my phone much less, and with very little to do on the watch it is a net decrease in computing activity. It's actually very freeing.

Before Pebble, receiving a mere notification (of which I receive dozens per day) involved taking out and activating my phone and (while I'm here) clicking in to the notifying app and (before I go) checking out some other apps. Now, my phone neither rings nor vibrates, it sits quietly in my pocket. Now, receiving a notification involves a subtle vibration on my wrist and a glance, usually nothing more.
