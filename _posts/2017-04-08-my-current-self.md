title: My Current Self
---

Concerning my own life, the responsibility of my current self is:

1. to evaluate the benefit and detriment to my current and future selves that my past selves have produced,
  - and venerate those past selves who have produced the most benefit,
  - and contemn those past selves who have produced the most detriment,
2. to decide how best to produce maximum benefit for the maximum number of my future selves,
3. and to do it.

I'm aware of the temptation for my current self to be too forgiving of past selves so as to avoid its own responsibility to future selves.

The ultimate of self-indulgence is behavior that only benefits the current self or a very small number of very near future selves.

Mental health requires occassional self-indulgence, but the primary obligation of my current self -- where my own life is concerned -- should be to serve future selves for the maximum increasing quality of the whole remainder of my life.

I believe this approach is the most significant contributor to great increases in the quality of my life over time.
